| You must have password-less ssh on department machines. See                  |
| www.cs.colostate.edu/~info/faq for more info. All servers currently run on   | 
| port 35005. All files will stored to /tmp/Tolooee_480 on the servers. The    |
| default replication level is 3. To change this,  change the argument to the  |
| config.sh script to the desired replication level.                           |
|                                                                              |
| Steps to get running:                                                        |
|                                                                              |
| 1.) start a bash shell with "bash" command and set DHT_HOMEDIR to the root   |
|      of the project --  "export path/to/project"                             |
|                                                                              |
| 2.) edit the $DHT_HOMEDIR/conf/servers file to select which machines will    | 
|   included in the cluster one machine name per line. The first name listed   |
|   will host the Metadata Server.                                             |
|                                                                              |
| 3.) run "$DHT_HOMEDIR/conf/killServers.sh" to make sure there are no servers |
|      already up                                                              |
|                                                                              |
| 4.) cd to $DHT_HOMEDIR/src and run the "make" to compile                     |
|                                                                              |
| 5.) run "$DHT_HOMEDIR/conf/config.sh" to bring all servers in the config     |
|      file up. You can optionally add an integer argument to determine the    |
|      replication level. The default is 3.                                    |   
|                                                                              |
| 6.) cd to $DHT_HOMEDIR/bin and run the following commands to use the system: |
|                                                                              |
|      "java Client store file_name drs_filename" -- to store a local file     |
|      "java Client get drs_filename" -- to retrieve a file from the system    |
|      "java Client status" -- for status                                      |
|                                                                              |
| 7.) Once finished run "$DHT_HOMEDIR/conf/killServers.sh" to bring down the   |
|      servers specified in the servers file.                                  |
|                                                                              |
