| You must have password-less ssh on department machines. See 				   |
| www.cs.colostate.edu/~info/faq for more info. All servers currently run on   | 
| port 35005.																   |
| 																			   |
| Steps to get running:														   |
| 																			   |
| 1.) start bash shell with "bash" command and set DHT_HOMEDIR to the root of  |
| 	  the project "export path/to/project"									   |
| 																			   |
| 2.) edit the servers file to select which machines will included in the 	   | 
| 	cluster one machine name per line (ip addresses should work but untested). |
| 	The first name listed will host the MetaDataServer.    				   	   |
| 																			   |
| 3.) run "./killServers.sh" to make sure there are no servers already up	   |
| 																			   |
| 4.) cd to $DHT_HOMEDIR/src and run the "make" to compile					   |
| 																			   |
| 5.) run "./config.sh" to bring all servers in the config file up			   |
| 																			   |
| 6.) run "java Client store file_name" to store a local file to the DHT	   |
| 	run "java Client status" for DHT status 								   |
| 																			   |

As always, Work in progress!
